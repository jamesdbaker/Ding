Ding!
====

Ding! is a small web-based kitchen timer. You tell it what you're cooking for dinner, and it will work out when you need to start cooking each bit.

Ding! comes with a few example recipes and ingredients, but the intention is that you will customise it to the food and cooking times you use.
